# Google-Colab-2
Mnist is a simple example of building and training a neural network for MNIST dataset using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colaboratory Notebook. The steps are as follows.

- Load TensorFlow 2.0, Keras and Python libraries.
- Load the Mnist training and testing dataset.
- Preprocess the data.
- Explore the dataset.
- Build a simple model.
- Train the model on training data.
- Evaluate the model on test data.
- Use the model for predictions.
- Verify predictions.
